LoMapüìç by HappySw, is the ultimate personalized map application that brings the city to the fingertips of the user! It offers a unique and tailored experience that lets the user discover the hidden gems of their city. It is a cutting-edge software system designed to help citizens easily navigate their city and find local businesses, sights, culture, and more. The app offers personalized maps that are fully controlled by the user, allowing them to create a customized experience that fits their interests and preferences.

With LoMap, you'll have access to a vast array of places, including shops, bars, restaurants, and cultural destinations, all in one convenient location. And because the shared information is stored in a personal pod according to the SOLID project, you can rest assured that your data is safe and secure.

The initial focus is on the user, giving them the power to create their own personal map of the places they live and also it allows places such as shops and restaurants to create their own digital space, so you can get an even more detailed and immersive experience. 

And although it was developed specifically for the Council of Brussels, HappySw is committed to creating a generic software solution that can be deployed and used in other cities, so everyone can enjoy the benefits of this app.
