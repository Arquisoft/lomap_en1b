== System Scope and Context

LoMap is a software system designed to provide users with personalized maps about places and local businesses in their city. 
The maps will be under the full control of the users and the shared information will be stored in personal pod according to the SOLID project.

Another feature of the application will be to allow places to create their own space, like a digital version of their physical place.

The system will allow users to add locations in different categories, see places and information about those places taken from their friends, show the locations in a map window, add review scores, comments... 

The user is able to add locations in different categories, add review scores, comments, or pictures about the added places. It also will be possible to manage from the application the information that is accessible with other users and friendships. 


The system is structured in two parts: a frontend and a backend. The user only interfaces with the frontend, which in turn interfaces with the backend, which then works with the Solid Pod provider and the database serve the data the frontend might need.
The credentials of the users are stored in the PODs and the maps service provides the application with a visual map to show it to the user.

The frontend of the application is made with React, Redux and has a Map API wich provides the application with visual maps. The frontend will communicate with the Solid POD by means of a library that is not determined yet.

The Map will be used to search for an API and it will make HTTPS requests. It will also communicate with the backend of the application using a technology that is not determined yet.

The user will access the frontend of the application by using different devices such as a PC or a smartphone.
