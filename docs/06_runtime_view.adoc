== Runtime View


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their *architectural relevance*. It is *not* important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

.Motivation
You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system perform their job and communicate at runtime.
You will mainly capture scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the static models (building block view, deployment view).

.Form
There are many notations for describing scenarios, e.g.

* numbered list of steps (in natural language)
* activity diagrams or flow charts
* sequence diagrams
* BPMN or EPCs (event process chains)
* state machines
* ...

=== User registration
* The user enters the system for the first time and registers their personal data to create an account and start ussing the webapp.
** The user will be able to fill a form with their data that is saved on their private POD.


=== User Login
* The user already registered on the system and wants to log in with their user and password to acess the webapp.
** The user will be able to fill a form with their user and password that will be sent to the server to be authenticated and allow or deny access.


=== Adding a Location
* The user wants to add the location restaurant to the webapp and see it on the map.
** The user will be able to select a location category and the coordinates for the location to be placed and seen on their map and it will be saved on their POD.


=== Reviewing information about a place
* The user wants to select a friend's added location and see the pictures they added to it.
** Locations made public or shared with the user will be able to be accesed by the user to review aditional information that the creator added to the place.


=== Changing privacy settings
* The user doesn't want their friends seeing the locations she added to the map so they acess the settings of the webapp to disable sharing them.
** The different settings about what information on the places and the user is accesible by their friends will be able to be changed, giving different options for each parameter.


=== Adding a new friend
* A user navigating the app wants to search and add a concrete friend to their friend list.
** The user will be able to write the user of a friend that, if in the database, will be added to their personal friend list and the connection stored on the database.


=== Deleting a friend
* A user wants to remove a friend from their friend list.
** The user will be given the option to remove a frient from their list, if they do the system wont consider them a friend and all places shared with them will no longer be shared.


=== Creating a friend group
* The user wants to create a group of friends and manage privacy on the group.
** The group of friends will be treated as a single friend, after creation it will be stored on the database and the information that is shared or not will affect the whole group.
