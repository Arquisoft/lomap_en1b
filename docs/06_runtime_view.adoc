== Runtime View

=== User Login
* The user wants to log in with their POD to access the webapp.
** The user will be able to fill a form that will redirect him to its POD's provider in order to give the application access to its POD's information or deny it.
** The structure of the login is not as simple as a typical login flow, since it is not managed by our application but by the users Solid POD provider. The information flow works as follows:

=== Adding a Location
* The user wants to add the location restaurant to the webapp and see it on the map.
** The user will click on a place on the map and a form will be displayed where the user will be able to select a location category and the name for the location to be placed and seen on their map and it will be saved on their POD.


=== Reviewing information about a place
* The user wants to select a friend's added location and see the pictures they added to it.
** Locations made public or shared with the user will be able to be accessed by the user to review additional information that the creator added to the place.
** When accessing any shared resource (not only shared locations, but reviews as well), the information flow does not go through only the user´s pod, but through our database as well. This database´s intention is not to manage the user´s data (the "master" data is always the one stored in the pod), but improve performance by reducing the calls to external places.

=== Changing privacy settings (Not implemented yet)
* The user doesn't want their friends seeing the locations she added to the map so they acess the settings of the webapp to disable sharing them.
** The different settings about what information on the places and the user is accesible by their friends will be able to be changed, giving different options for each parameter.


=== Adding a new friend
* A user navigating the app wants to search and add a concrete friend to their friend list.
** The user will be able to write the WebId of a friend's POD and also a NickName just to be similar to an agenda.


=== Deleting a friend (Not implemented yet)
* A user wants to remove a friend from their friend list.
** The user will be given the option to remove a friend from their list, if they do the system wont consider them a friend and all places shared with them will no longer be shared.


=== Creating a friend group (Not implemented yet)
* The user wants to create a group of friends and manage privacy on the group.
** The group of friends will be treated as a single friend, after creation it will be stored on the database and the information that is shared or not will affect the whole group.
