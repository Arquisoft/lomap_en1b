|Risks/Technical debt|Description
|Delivery time|We are limited by the deadline of the course and also by the time we'll spend working on the other courses.
|Knowledge of SOLID|It's our first time using this technology so we have no idea of how to work with it. We will spend some time researching and practising.
|GitHub|Some of the team members are facing pull request and branches for the first time, so it will take time to be confortable using GitHub for the team.
|Lack of knowledge of some technologies|We have no experience working with React or Typescript.
|Big project and big team|We are 6 people working on that project, so communication will be crucial. We must help and collaborate with everyone in order to have good developer experience among this project.
|Database dependency|Right now, there is no functionality developed to restore the shared resources of users. If the database gets corrupted or the data is lost, a script to reload every shared resource will need to be implemented
|Lack of component modularity in webAPP|Right now most components in the WebAPP are not well differentiated. Upgrading or extending their functionality could be more complex than it should.
|Pod Provider dependency|Although we do have data redundancy with the cache database, we still depend on the provider in order to do the login or access the "master" data of the users.
