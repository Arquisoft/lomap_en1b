“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

.Form

|Risks/Technical debt|Description
|Delivery time|We are limited by the deadline of the course and also by the time we'll spend working on the other courses.
|Knowledge of SOLID|It's our first time using this technology so we have no idea of how to work with it. We will spend some time researching and practising.
|GitHub|Some of the team members are facing pull request and branches for the first time, so it will take time to be confortable using GitHub for the team.
|Lack of knowledge of some technologies|We have no experience working with React or Typescript.
|Big project and big team|We are 6 people working on that project, so communication will be crucial. We must help and collaborate with everyone in order to have good developer experience among this project.
