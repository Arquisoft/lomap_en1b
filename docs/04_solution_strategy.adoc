== Solution Strategy

=== Technology decisions
This are the technologies that we have decided to use, some of them may vary in future iterations of the poyect:

* SOLID PODs for security
* TypeScript as programming language
* MongoDb as our cache DMBS
* Redux using React as UI
* Chakra UI (for the implementation of the views)


=== Design decisions:
The general design decisions.

* Project has two main parts, connected using a facade:
** Webapp (frontend): It has different views, it communicates with the user with different views, and with the backend using redux hooks
** RestAPI (backend): controls the access to the data. This data can be stored in the user's POD or in our database
* The application will have two sessions, one for the webApp and another one for the restAPI.
** The webAPP session will be used to link the webAPP with the restAPI.
** The restAPI session will be created after authenticating with the corresponding solid provider. It will contain the authenticated fetch for private resources in the pod.

* Use of a local database to cache shared resources and improve performance.

* Resources stored in the POD will be RDF resources and will follow as close as possible the schema.org specification.

=== Organizational decisions
* All developments will be recorded in an issue and added to the kanban board of the project, where its state will be updated periodically.
* All developments will be done in a personal branch forked from the "develop" branch. When the functionality is finished, it will be merged to the "develop" branch with a pull-request.
* When the "develop" branch reaches a stable point, it will be merged to the "master" branch.
* Documentation changes will not be done in the "develop" branch, but in the "documentation" branch, following the same strategy.


=== Quality decisions
The main quality attributes that we will focus on are the following:
[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Quality goal|Scenario|Solution approach
|Privacy|Any user using our application will feel their data is secure | We will use SOLID Pods to ensure that user's data is not compromised.
|Usability|All users, regardless of their level, are able to navigate and use the application correctly|We will use UX conventions to ensure that the app has its components presented in a familiar way
|Accessibility|All users, regardless of their physical and mental capabilities should be able to use the application.|We are going to use external accesibility tools.
