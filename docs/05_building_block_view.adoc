== Building Block View

The LoMap application is mainly divided into two modules with very differentiated behaviour: the WebAPP and the RestAPI. Each of the modules has several components, focused in smaller functionalities.

=== Black box view

==== Level 1
The LoMap application is divided into two modules, each of which interact with different external services.

.WebApp
The web app is the module responsible for managing the communication with the user. It will manage the GUI by means of different views, some of which access an external API to implement the map Leaflet. It communicates with the Rest API (described later on) with http requests.
On login, it redirects the user to its POD provider to handle the login process, but doesn't access the POD's data

.RestAPI
The rest API will manage the business logic and access the data of the application. The data will be stored in the user's POD for maintaining the data secured. Some other non-sensitive data will be stored in the database for better performance

It will receive the petitions of the web app (described before), process them, access the necessary information and return a response in form of data.


==== Level 2

Each of the previously mentioned modules is divided into smaller components, whose behaviour is described in this section.

.Views
Component responsible for rendering the GUI.

.Solid access
Component in charge of accessing the user solid POD. Right now this component is in the Web App module, but it could change during the development of the project.


.Facade
Component in charge of receiving the petitions and manage them. Responsible for the business logic.

.DB access
Component in charge of accessing the database. Reads, stores, updates and deletes information.
